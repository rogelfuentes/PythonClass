# Exercise 3: my name (2 points)

# Create two variables called first_name and last_name. 
# Assign these two variables to your name accordingly. 
# Using the print function in Python, make it print the following statement in one line:
# Hello, my name is FirstName LastName. (The output would naturally be your name)

first_name = "Rogel"
last_name = "Fuentes"

print( first_name + " " + last_name)
