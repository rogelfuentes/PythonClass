# Exercise #1: (5 points)
# Write a program that generates the following pattern. Use functions to break up the problem into reusable blocks of code.

# Code Example:
# def topOrBottom():
#     print ("#####")
# Output:

# #####
# #      #
#   # #
#    #
#   # #
# #      #
# #####

 

# Exercise #2: (5 points)
# Write a function that converts a number from feet to inches (12 inches in a foot) and another function that converts feet to meters (0.3048 meters in a foot). Each function should accept a single argument and use that argument to calculate the conversion and print the result. Next, write a program that generates the following output - make sure to use your functions in your program!

# 0 ft:
# ... 0 inches
# ... 0 meters
# 1 ft:
# ... 12 inches
# ... 0.3048 meters
# 2 ft:
# ... 24 inches
# ... 0.6096 meters
# 3 ft:
# ... 36 inches
# ... 0.9144 meters
# 4 ft:
# ... 48 inches
# ... 1.2192 meters
# 5 ft:
# ... 60 inches
# ... 1.524 meters
# 6 ft:
# ... 72 inches
# ... 1.8288 meters
# 7 ft:
# ... 84 inches
# ... 2.1336 meters
# 8 ft:
# ... 96 inches
# ... 2.4384 meters
# 9 ft:
# ... 108 inches
# ... 2.7432 meters
 


# Exercise #3: (5 points)
# Write a function that rolls two dice. Your function should be designed to accept a single argument (an integer) and generate two die rolls between 1 and the number supplied. Your function should then return the two rolls in ascending order. Next, write a program that rolls 5 sets of dice with different sides. Here's a sample running of your program:

# 6 sided dice roll: 2 & 4
# 7 sided dice roll: 3 & 4
# 8 sided dice roll: 1 & 8
# 9 sided dice roll: 7 & 7
# 10 sided dice roll: 4 & 6
 

 

# Exercise #4: (5 points)
# Create a dictionary of technical terms and allow the user to lookup the definitions of these terms from the dictionary. Use the following list for your dictionary:
# 'dict', 'list', 'map', or 'set'

# You can use the following resource:
# dict = “stores a key/value pair”
# list = “stores a value at each index”
# map = “see dict”
# set = “stores unordered unique elements”

# Based on the user's input, print the term and the definition.
# Make “exit” a term in the dictionary. Prompt the user to enter a term inside a while loop until the user types the word “exit”.
