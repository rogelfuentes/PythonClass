# In-class exercise 3 - for loops

# #1 Input with a for-loop (4.5 points)
# Asks the user for how many numbers they want to add.  Reads in each number and prints a total at the end.
# Hint: use the range() function: for i in range(quantity):

addNum = int(input("How many numbers do you want to add? :"))




 

# #2 Find the vowels – for loop (4.5 points)
# Using the 'if' statement and the 'or' operator, write a program that uses the input() function and asks the user for a word or sentence.
# Print the number of vowels in the string that’s returned from the input() function.
# Use the 'or' operator inside the 'if' condition.

# Pseudo code:
# Prompt user for a word or phrase.
# total = 0
# enter 'for' loop:
# for each letter, check if the letter is an 'a,e,i,o or u'. 
# If a match, then +1 to total.
# end loop.
# Print total results.
 

# Pront user input
# How many times?
# for each time:
#     value=input "enter ....."
#     total += value 

#     print total
